		- Puzzle Possibilities
			- Disguise
			- 
	- Theme(s): Women aren't property, love outweighs social norms/standards. Friar Tuck personifies the difference between legality and morality. He lives the teachings of his religion, differs from the other friarts Robin has encountered. Friendship is still an overarching theme

	- Story Event I: Robin meets Sir Richard of Lea and learns his tale. Robin befriends him. Little John simultaneously brings 3 friars and a bishop to dine with them.

	- Story Event III: A year passes and Sir Richard restores his lands. Sir Richard travels to Sherwood and repays his debt to Robin by 4x the initial amount plus expensive bows and arrows. While travelling Sir Richard saves a man, similarly to how Robin saved him.
	- Theme(s): Sir Richard is taken advantage of by a corrupt system. Robin seeks to right that. The Bishop, Prior and Sheriff are abusing the system. The Bishop and Prior in particular have far more wealth than they need or are entitled to. Robin does not impoverish the rich by stealing but seeks a balance in an unfair system. Loyalty and friendship are again highlighted. Good deeds are paid forward and can extend beyond one persons reach. (Sir Richard learns from Robin and his men and saves another life)




- Part VI:
	- Story Event I: Robin and Little John set if in search of adventure. Little John encounters 2 friars and steals from them(after they lie). Robin encounters a beggar and tries to convince the beggar to trade clothes. The beggar refuses and they fight. Robin wins and the beggar confesses he did not want to trade because he had money hidden in his clothes. They trade clothes and Robin lets the beggar keep his money.

	- Story Event III: Robin encounters a corn dealer who is known for taking advantage of people. Robin pretends to be a beggar to earn the corn dealers trust. It works and eventually Robin reveals his true identity and forces the corn dealer to hand over his money.
	- Theme(s): They believe many of the religious men do not practice what they preach. Robin steals from the second group of beggars because they are dishonest while letting the first keep his money because he was honest. Shows once again assumptions cannot be trusted. Shows hypocrisy on Robin and Little Johns parts, Robin looks down on trickery but uses it himself(Evil acts for a good ending?). Robin is imperfect




Part VII:
	- Story Event I: Another archery comp is held. Robin is personally invited by Queen Eleanor. She promises no harm will come to him. Robin agrees to attend with Little John, Will Scarlet, and Allen aDale. Before the comp Queen Eleanor wagers with King Henry that her archers(Robin and his merry men) will outshoot his, he agrees if they will they will be pardoned for 40 days. During the Comp Robin and his merry men are recognized by Bishop of Hereford. The king is furious but Robin and his men win, but give most of their winnings to the other contestants. The Queens page wars Robin of the kings anger and they leave.
	- Story Event II: The Bishop of Hereford suggests to the king that he not uphold his promise of pardon for Robin and his men. He sends his men after Robin. Robin splits from his men, they escape into Sherwood Forest.
	- Story Event III: After splitting from his men, Robin encounters the kins men on the road to Sherwood. He avoids their arrows and makes it to safety. Eventually runs into a cobbler and they switch clothes. The cobbler is eventually arrested because he is believed to be Robin. Robin steals a friars clothes, runs into Sir Richard of Lea on the road back to Sherwood. Sir Richard advises Robin to return to London and beg for mercy from Queen Eleanor, which Robin does. The Queen convinces the King to allow Robin to return to Sherwood.
	-Theme(s): Robin puts innocents at risk to save himself(cobbler). Robin is desperate at this point. His previous generosity and his friendshipl to Sir Richard save him through Sir Richards actions. Robin is now famous(different from first archery comp) so he fears the powerful less. Robin is at this point only guilty of making the King and Bishop of Hereford look foolish, but they still try to arrest him. Demonstrates Robin Hoods point that the legal system is flawed.




Part VIII:
	- Story Event I: A long time passes, Robin leaves Sherwood less and less. King Henry dies, succeeded by King Richard. Robin and Little John set off in search of adventure. They encounter Guy of Gisbourne, a known outlaw, sent by the Sheriff to catch Robin. After beating Guy in a archer comp, Robin reveals hmself, a fight ensues. Robin kills Guy and dresses in his clothes. Robin sets of to find the Sheriff.
	- Story Event II: Little John encounters a crying women. Her sons were arrested for killing the Kings deer (same as Robin) and are now to be hanged at an inn by the Sheriff (the Sheriff is also waiting there for Guy to bring him Robin). Little John disguises himself as an old man and travels to the inn. He asks the Sheriff for money. Sheriff agrees if Little John hangs the men. Little John secretly unties the men and states he will shoot them after they hang to ensure they are dead. The men escape but Little John is captured. Robin shows up, disguised as Guy of Gisbourne, and shows him the horn of Robin Hood as evidence that Robin is dead. The Sheriff celebrates. Robin offers to 'kill' Little John but instead calls his merry men using his horn. They chase off the Sheriff and his men. Return to Sherwood.
	- Story Event III: A few months pass, King Richard is set to visit Nottingham. After hearing of Robin Hood, the King decides to clear the forest of Robin and his men when he visits.

Robin intentionally loses. Little John returns to camp with Sir Richard of Lea, who recognizes the King. Sir Richard tells his tale to the King and how he owes his life to Robin. Sir Richard vows his life to protect Robin. The King pardons Robin and his men on the condition that they leave Sherwood forest. They agree. Robin, Little John, Will Scarlett, and Allan aDale return with the King to London and become royal rangers and caretakers of Sherwood Forest.
	- Theme(s): Story comes full circle. Guy Gisbourne represents the path Robin could have followed as an outlaw. He chose a life of friendship and generosity. Guy is the first man Robin has killed since the ranger (Prologue). Little Johns adventure shows morality over legality. Friendship and loyalty. Difference between King Henry and King Richard




Epilogue: 
	- Story Event I: King Richard is killed in battle. Robin, now the Earl of Huntingdon, returns to Sherwood. King John granted him permission. Upon his return he blows his horn and Robin and his men reunite. The king hears this news and sends the Sheriff and Sir William Dale to bring Robin Hood back.

He vows revenge on the prioress but Robin urges him to forgive. Little John agrees and helps Robin shoot one last arrow and gaze upon the forest. Robin's merry men party ways and are left alone by the new Sheriff.
	- Theme(s): Friendship. Forgiveness. Robin is still comitted to his same morals. He doesn't succumb to the sense of vengeance the legal system does.
